            In 1974 Roger Penrose published his first aperiodic tiling of the 2D plane.
            It consisted of 6 repeating shapes, called prototiles.

        Prototiles in a Penrose tiling can be {\it deflated} into 
        prototiles of the same family, smaller by a constant factor. 
        This creates a fractal-like self similarity: extending the 
        tiling is the same as decomposing and scaling.

        \column{0.5\textwidth}
            Decomposing the tiling will not create any periodicity because
            the resulting pattern contains the same aperiodic pattern of
            the parent.

        % Think of it in reverse:
        % Assume there is a distance that is a translational symmetry, 
        %    and it exists within the right tiling.
        % we can INFLATE the tiling (combine the prototiles to make them larger)
        %    This should preserve the translational symmetry 
        %    BECAUSE the pattern is self similar
        % But, we can alwas inflate to a pattern that isn't periodic,
